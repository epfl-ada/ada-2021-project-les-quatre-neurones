**PROPOSITIONS PROJECT**

Tatiana: 
Proposal 1: What’s the influence of the speaker or her/his quote?
I would find it interesting to analyse the impact of the quote in society through different options. One could imagine to try to find the origin (type of communication) of the quote via the links of the articles and to see the reaction of people through social networks, for example if it’s in an article or a book, we could look at how many times it has been quoted. I would also find it interesting to find a way to link to the h-index of the author of the quote if she/he has one. 
*Feedback*: I really liked that you start every proposal with a main research question. Perhaps you could try to break down the main question into smaller ones and smaller tasks so that they are easier to answer.

Proposal 2: Are quotes linked to an event? 
One could imagine trying to track all the events that took place during a year, for example, just by trying to group quotes by context, words and dates. If the quotes are listed by context one could try to find a dataset that contains the important events related to the topic. If we look for example at the word in the dataset “Brexit,” we can see that 43 quotes out of 338 quotes (~12%) were in December and if we look in the Wikipedia page “2019 in the United Kingdom”, we see that on December 20th, MPs voted for the Brexit withdrawal agreement, “paving the way for the UK to leave the EU on January 31, 2020”. There’s surely a link, but it would be necessary to push the analysis.
*Feedback*: Great motivation and example. It would be great if you started thinking about possible ways (methods) to answer your questions. How are you going to group the quotes? Are you going to focus on all topics of specific ones? What are some possible hypotheses?

Proposition 3: What’s the feeling in the quotes? 
We could start by trying to understand whether the quote is turned in a positive or negative way (we could make other comparisons). Depending on the context of the quote, we could try to imagine a way to trace the general feeling in the context over several years. Then check if different contexts are also related to this general feeling. The Covid has influenced everyone’s life, and I would have found it interesting through quotes to see how much it has affected or influenced in certain contexts.
*Feedback*: I like this idea. I would suggest to see how it affects different populations (age groups, gender, nationalities, etc).

Arthur 1 : Speak like someone: by analyzing quotes and linking them to their most probable author, one could imagine building a model that can help speak like someone else. For example, the model would analyze how a notorious politician speaks, find a generic pattern in the declarations he makes, the expression he usually employs… Finally, the model would then be used to speak like (or avoid speaking like) the original character studied. A new politician could for example scan a speech he’s about to make and see how much he’s going to sound like someone else, then decide to adapt his speech in consequence. _Feedback_ : _What could be the implications of this work? Are there any ethical considerations?_

Arthur 2 : The influence of keywords: the goal would be to compare different people’ takes of the same event, to see how the choice of keywords, the phrasing of a sentence, can influence the readers’ opinions. In the first place, one should select an event that was widely covered by people from different backgrounds and political orientation (e.g., a presidential election) and compare how they differ. One should then compare the general tone of the declaration by the people from each background, analyze everyone’s confidence, how the speeches change as the event approaches, what happens when unlikely events arise (e.g., political scandals) and see how much the declaration they make before the election do come true afterwards. Since we have data from 2008 to 2020, we can cross-validate the conclusions we make with what truly happened during that time (in the example of elections). _Feedback :  This idea is fantastic! Which external datasets do you need? How are you planning on getting them?_

Arthur 3 : Analysis of the phrasing of sentences: in a given sentence, according to how it is formulated, it can have a different meaning. For example, in the sentence: “I’m watching the man with binoculars”, are we watching a man through binoculars, or are we watching a man who is holding binoculars? We can think of analyzing a pool of quotes from each speaker in the hope of clarifying the quotes that can be interpreted in several ways, according to how the speaker usually phrases his/her quotes, and perhaps cross-check it with online dictionaries to get the most probable meaning. We would need to give more importance to the recent data, since something one has said in 2010 might be less relevant than something he said in 2019. The model should also be able to detect sarcasm or irony. In short, the ultimate goal would be to be able to paraphrase correctly a given unclear quote. _Feedback : What is the motivations? Who could benefit from this? Sarcasm and irony are the hardest emotions to detect, I am looking forward to see your findings!_
