**PROPOSITIONS PROJECT**

Tatiana: 
Proposal 1: What’s the influence of the speaker or her/his quote?
I would find it interesting to analyse the impact of the quote in society through different options. One could imagine to try to find the origin (type of communication) of the quote via the links of the articles and to see the reaction of people through social networks, for example if it’s in an article or a book, we could look at how many times it has been quoted. I would also find it interesting to find a way to link to the h-index of the author of the quote if she/he has one. 
*Feedback*: I really liked that you start every proposal with a main research question. Perhaps you could try to break down the main question into smaller ones and smaller tasks so that they are easier to answer.

Proposal 2: Are quotes linked to an event? 
One could imagine trying to track all the events that took place during a year, for example, just by trying to group quotes by context, words and dates. If the quotes are listed by context one could try to find a dataset that contains the important events related to the topic. If we look for example at the word in the dataset “Brexit,” we can see that 43 quotes out of 338 quotes (~12%) were in December and if we look in the Wikipedia page “2019 in the United Kingdom”, we see that on December 20th, MPs voted for the Brexit withdrawal agreement, “paving the way for the UK to leave the EU on January 31, 2020”. There’s surely a link, but it would be necessary to push the analysis.
*Feedback*: Great motivation and example. It would be great if you started thinking about possible ways (methods) to answer your questions. How are you going to group the quotes? Are you going to focus on all topics of specific ones? What are some possible hypotheses?

Proposition 3: What’s the feeling in the quotes? 
We could start by trying to understand whether the quote is turned in a positive or negative way (we could make other comparisons). Depending on the context of the quote, we could try to imagine a way to trace the general feeling in the context over several years. Then check if different contexts are also related to this general feeling. The Covid has influenced everyone’s life, and I would have found it interesting through quotes to see how much it has affected or influenced in certain contexts.
*Feedback*: I like this idea. I would suggest to see how it affects different populations (age groups, gender, nationalities, etc).
